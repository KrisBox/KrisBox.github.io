                        <p>
                            Saturday 28th November was my 19th birthday. Receiving all my cards and presents in the post
                            in the week leading up to the day, I was getting more and more excited to spend my first
                            birthday in Sheffield. Having my sister come and see me for the day and night truly made my
                            birthday more enjoyable with spending the day at the christmas markets and winning 8-2 in the
                            football. To top a good day off, we went to town during the night with the flat and my sister's
                            friend. Genuinely a birthday to remember.

                            This week was my first week as a Computer Scientist. It was a very interesting week, having
                            introductions to what all my modules will be teaching throughout the year. I am very excited
                            to be getting into this degree and to develop my skills in the field. Also this week, we met our
                            tutors and was given free pizza and beer! A wonderful welcoming gift I must admit. I enjoy the
                            busy timetable with the variety of areas being covered. Much preferred to some of my flat mates
                            who only have a handful of hours per week. Also, we won the Lego Robot football competition!

                        <p>
                            Today I moved into my flat. After a tedious journey from Burnley through Snakes Pass, and many
                            trips up and down the stairs to move my stuff around, we are finally here and moving in! Meeting
                            all my new flat mates is a real buzz, very excited to get to know them better. It was sad to see
                            the parents leave but I am very excited to start the course next week. The picture to the right
                            is an image of the room just after moving in.
