                            My name is Kristofer Box and I reside from a small town in Lancashire called Burnley. I am
                            18 and currently studying the first year of Computer Science at the University of Sheffield.
                            I previously attended a college in Burnley named 'Burnley College' where I achieved my A Levels
                            in the Summer of 2015. Now currently living in the village of Endcliffe accommodation with 9
                            other flat mates, I am quickly reaching the end of my first semester. Whilst studying at the
                            university, I wish to become an efficient programmer and web based specialist.

                            Whilst not at the university I live in a medium sized town house with my mother, step father
                            and sister. Named Susan, Graeme and Amie respectively, we all reside from Burnley and have
                            2 cats called Max and Claude. The rest of my family are spread across the country in
                            Manchester, Newcastle, Cambridge. Close relatives of mine also live in New York in the United
                            States of America.<br>
                            After my unfortunate parent split, my father moved to Cambridge and married my step mother
                            Allison, who has two children called Sam and Matt. He moved closer to my Grandma in Cambridge
                            and has stayed there ever since.

                            My home town, Burnley, is situated in the east of Lancashire in the Pennine hill range. A 15
                            minute drive from West Yorkshire and half an hour drive from Manchester, it has close
                            connections to major hubs. As a popular industrial and football town, proudly supported by
                            Prince Charles himself, Burnley has a rich heritage and history. The popular Pendle hill is
                            located closely to Burnley making it a good location for walking hobbyists.

                        The odd spelling of my name, Kristofer, is derived from the famous actor and singer Kris
                        Kristofferson. This odd name spelling is a theme in the family as my sisters name is spelt Amie
                        instead of the conventional Amy.

                        Burnley FC is most known for its involvement in the creation of the Football League with 11
                        other teams in 1888. Even to this day, they are still progressing well in the Football League.

                        In high school, I was surprisingly given the role of Head Boy for year 11 despite the popularity
                        and expectations of other students leaving mass arguments amongst other students, a very fun
                        year indeed!
